# HacktoberFest2023
HacktoberFest, in its 10th year, is a month-long celebration of open-source software run by DigitalOcean. It is an excellent opportunity for everyone, from seasoned developers to students and code newbies, from technical writers to UX designers, to contribute to open-source communities and develop your skills, with the perks of winning limited edition items. 
You can do this in a variety of ways:

-Prepare and share your project for collaboration

-Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests

-Organize an event

-Mentor others

-Donate directly to open-source projects
