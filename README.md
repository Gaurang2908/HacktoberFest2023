# HacktoberFest2023
Hacktoberfest, in its 10th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean.

You can do this in a variety of ways:

Prepare and share your project for collaboration
Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
Organize an event
Mentor others
Donate directly to open source projects
